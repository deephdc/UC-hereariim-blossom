blossom
==============================

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.indigo-datacloud.eu/buildStatus/icon?job=Pipeline-as-code/DEEP-OC-org/UC-hereariim-blossom/master)](https://jenkins.indigo-datacloud.eu/job/Pipeline-as-code/job/DEEP-OC-org/job/UC-hereariim-blossom/job/master)

We suggest a 2D image segmentation model based on UNET algorithm to segment images with blossoming apple tree
